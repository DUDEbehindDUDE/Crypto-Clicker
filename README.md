# Crypto Clicker

Crypto clicker is an idle game/clicker where you click a Bitcoin, and use the Bitcoins you get from that to purchase and upgrade more systems to earn you more Bitcoin.

This project was initially made for the 2023/24 Create PT Task, and commit e5c4c4be38c90bb56ba506d81fdf53ffd8a62db2 was what I actually submitted.

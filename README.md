# Crypto Clicker

Crypto clicker is an idle game/clicker where you click a Bitcoin, and use the Bitcoins you get from that to purchase and upgrade more systems to earn you more Bitcoin. The site is built using React, and a live version of the site (built from the latest commit) can be found at [https://dudebehinddude.github.io/Crypto-Clicker/](https://dudebehinddude.github.io/Crypto-Clicker/) (case sensitive).

## Run/Build project

This project was initially made for the 2023/24 Create PT Task, and commit [e5c4c4b](https://github.com/DUDEbehindDUDE/Crypto-Clicker/commit/e5c4c4be38c90bb56ba506d81fdf53ffd8a62db2) was what I actually submitted.
